## A Brief About Chat

If you want to create chat app, for customer service, for instance, Qiscus Chat SDK enable you to establish chat UI and  functionalities easily. But before dive into it, there are essential basic knowledges you need to know about chat app.

### Basic Flow of Chat App

In a chat app, to start a conversation, we usually choose person we want to chat with, from a contact list. Then, we start conversation inside a chat room. In a chat room, we can do things such as sharing images, sending emoji, sharing contact, location, and many more. We can even know when a person is typing or when our message has been read. If chatting is done, we can go back to the conversation list which display our conversations in the app.
To make a chat app with the described flow, we noticed that the most complex part is creating chat room, which posses many features inside it. Hence, Qiscus Chat SDK provide an easy way to create chat app without dealing with  complexity of real-time comunication infrastucture that resides inside a chat room.

## Try Sample App

To meet your expectations, we suggest you try out our sample app. The sample app is built with full functionalities so that you can figure out the flow and main activities of common chat apps.  We provide you with two options to start with the sample app: 
1) Try Sample App only or
2) Try Sample App with Sample Dashboard

### Try Sample App Only

If you simply want to try the IOS sample app, you can direct to our [github repository](https://github.com/qiscus/qiscus-sdk-ios-sample-v2) to clone our sample app. You can explore features of Qiscus Chat SDK.

If you are willing to change your own App ID, you can change it in **Helper.swift** file. Here is how it will look like:
```swift
...

class Helper: NSObject {
    static var APP_ID: String {
        get {
            return "YOUR_APP_ID"
        }
    }
    
    ...
```

### Try Sample App With Sample Dashboard
If you have your own chat app, you may be wondering how you can manage your users. In this case, we provide a sample dashboard for user management. This sample dashboard can help you to figure out how to work with Qiscus Server Api for more advanced functionalities. You can go to https://www.qiscus.com/documentation/rest/list-api to know more about Server API.

> Note: We assume that you already downloaded the sample app. The sample app will be needed to work together with the sample dashboard.

You can explore the sample dashboard http://dashboard-sample.herokuapp.com/ to try it online, or you also can download the source code to deploy it locally or to your own server.

To start trying the sample dashboard on your end, you should carry out the following steps:
Clone sample dashboard in our github (https://github.com/qiscus/dashboard-sample), or just copy the following code.

```cmd
git clone https://github.com/qiscus/dashboard-sample.git
cd dashboard-sample
```

Before running the sample app on your local, first, you need to install composer. 

```cmd
composer install
php -S localhost:8000
```

>The sample dashboard provided Client API to enable your sample app get list of users. This API is based on PHP and used Composer as its dependency manager. Thus, you need to have PHP and composer installed to use the API.

Now you would have successfully run the sample dashboard. However, do note that the sample app is running using our App ID. If you want the sample dashboard to be connected to your app with your own App ID, you need to change it inside *.env file*. You can find your own App ID and Secret Key in your own [Qiscus SDK dashboard](https://www.qiscus.com/dashboard).

If you are wondering how our sample app with dashboard worked, here some ilustration :
<p align="center"><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qiscus/qiscus-sdk-android/develop/screenshot/how_sample_work.png" width="80%" /><br/></p>

There are 2 Server API that are used inside Qiscus Sample Dashboard:

1. ```.qiscus.com/api/v2.1/rest/get_user_list``` to get list of users from Qiscus SDK database, and
2. ```.qiscus.com/api/v2/rest/login_or_register``` to enable user login or register via Sample Dashboard.

The Sample Dashboard called these APIs inside main.js file. To use these APIs, you need to pass your APP ID and  set method and request parameter.

To pass the APP ID, If you login to Sample Dashboard with your own APP ID and Secret Key, the APP ID and Secret Key has been saved, so that you need nothing to setup APP ID inside main.js.  

To set method and request parameter, you can refer to [Get User List](https://www.qiscus.com/documentation/rest/list-api#get-user-list) and [Login and Register](https://www.qiscus.com/documentation/rest/list-api#login-or-register) on Qiscus Server API Documentation.

The Sample Dashboard also provided API for client app to get list of users from the Sample Dasboard. 
To enable your client app to get list of users, you need to set your APP ID and Secret Key inside .env file. Then, you need to pass your domain name when calling the API.

```
//your-domain.com/api/contacts
Example: //dashboard-sample.herokuapp.com/api/contacts
```
You will get the response as follow:
```JSON
{
   "results":{
      "meta":{
         "total_data":123,
         "total_page":6
      },
      "users":[
         {
            "avatar_url":"https:\/\/d1edrlpyc25xu0.cloudfront.net\/kiwari-prod\/image\/upload\/75r6s_jOHa\/1507541871-avatar-mine.png",
            "created_at":"2017-12-05T08:07:58.405896Z",
            "email":"sample@email.com",
            "id":452773,
            "name":"sample",
            "updated_at":"2017-12-05T08:07:58.405896Z",
            "username":"sample"
         }
      ]
   },
   "status":200
}
```
